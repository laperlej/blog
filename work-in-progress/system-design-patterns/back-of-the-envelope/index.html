        <p>
          Back of the envelope estimation is a technique used to estimate the
          feasibility of a system design. It is a quick and dirty way to get a
          rough idea of the scale of a system.

        <p>
          Most interviews for software engineering positions will expect a
          senior level candidate to identify calculations that will impact the
          design and perform them on the spot.

            RPS in the 10k+ range is generally beyond the capabilities of a

            SQL database. Read/Write throughput is generally limited to sub 10k
            writes per second on a single machine if you want to write to disk
            to ensure durability. If you need to scale beyond that, you will
            need to shard your database.
          </li>
          <li>
            If data loss is acceptable, an in-memory database like Redis can
            handle 10k-1m read/writes per second.
          </li>
          <li>
            Batching can help reduce the number of writes to disk. It's a good
            way to extend the capabilities of a single machine if the requests
            are amenable to batching.
