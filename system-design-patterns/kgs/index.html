        <h2>Intro</h2>
        The Key Generation Service(KGS) problem is about generating unique
        values. It can be split into 2 categories, random and sequential. Some
        counter problems can be conceptualised as sequential key generation and
        have the same solutions.

        <h2>Example Problems</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Distribute 6M free burgers among 20M users (counter problem)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Strongly Consistent Sequential Keys</h2>
        <p>
          Fundamentally to have a strongly consistent serial value generator
          there must be a singular piece of memory somewhere in the system that
          must be accesses sequentially with lock. This is an unavoidable
          bottleneck.
        </p>
        <p>
          This type of KGS is a trap and is largely impossible to scale. Should
          be avoided if at all possible. If you encounter a problem with this
          pattern, start asking targeted clarifying questions to get some wiggle
          room. You must relax a requirement to make it feasible.
        </p>
        <p>Any of the following would do:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Do not have to be perfectly ordered (distribute numbers in batches)
          </li>
          <li>RPS is low / very low (single machine)</li>
          <li>
            RPS is medium / low and data loss is acceptable (in-memory single
            machine)
          </li>
        </ul>
