        <h3>CSRF Tokens</h3>
        <p>
          When a user's browser sends a request to a server, it includes any
          cookies that are set for that domain. This is how the server knows who
          the user is and can maintain a session. However, this also opens up
          the possibility of CSRF attacks. An attacker can trick a user into
          submitting a form that makes a request to the server on the user's
          behalf.
        </p>

        <p></p>
        <h3>How to prove that a request is initated from the same origin</h3>
        <p>
          To properly understand how CSRF token work it is important to
          understand that browsers enforce a same-origin policy. The same-origin
          policy is a security measure that only allow a script to read the
          contents of a cookie if the script is loaded from the same domain as
          the cookie. This means that an attacker cannot read the contents of a
          cookie set by another domain. In addition, the same-origin policy
          prevents cross-origin requests from including custom headers. This
          policy is what makes CSRF tokens effective.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key idea behind double submit is to issue a challenge to the
          client to prove that the request is being made from the same origin as
          the cookie. This is done by having the client read a token from a
          cookie and add it to a custom header in the http request. This
          effectively proves that the form is being submitted from the same
          origin as the cookie.
        </p>
        <p>
          HMAC double submit is a stateless way to accomplish this. It therefore
          pairs well with a JWT based authentication system. The key idea is

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>The server needs a secret key for encryption</li>
          <li>
            A message is created by concatenating the user's sessionID with a
            randomly generate value
          </li>
          <li>
            A cryptographic signature is generated using the secret key and the
            message
          </li>
          <li>
            The message is combined with the signature and put in a cookie
          </li>
          <li>
            The cookie is sent to the client with the HttpOnly flag set to false
          </li>
          <li>The client reads the cookie and extracts the token</li>
          <li>The client adds the token to the form as a hidden field</li>
          <li>
            On form submission, the server reads the token from the form and the
            cookie, compares them, verifies the signature and makes sure that it
            matches with the sessionID
          </li>
